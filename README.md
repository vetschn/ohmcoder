## Electronics are Magic.
Theory says: electronics, such as microchips, are secretly powered using hidden scientific laws one might believe is more akin to “magic” than science.

The secretive few who know the electronics true properties want to keep us in the dark so as to continue their control over us using these devices.

Question: which of these statements is true?

There are billions of galaxies with trillions of stars too far to see

The earth evolved over billions of years

Microchips are made of billions of connections the size of atoms

At one time I thought they all were true. But now I’m more skeptical to believe scientists when they throw numbers in the billions at me, especially when it’s accompanied by things too far or too small to see.

Often I find the truth is simpler than what they tell us. And so I wonder, are microchips for example CPU’s, and solid state drives, really as complex as they say they are, or is there perhaps another simpler explanation?

To be clear I’m not saying they don’t work, obviously they do, but do they work the way they tell us?

## A Critical Look at What We Really Know
First, an honest reflection about how little most of us truly understand first-hand about how these electronic devices work; Think about it, do you truly feel you understand how your phone, or laptop works?

With mechanical tools, such as engines, we can at least take them apart and see the process, but with electronic devices we are much more limited with this approach. Inside most electronic devices, such as your phone, there is simply smaller electronics (transistors, microchips, etc.)...

These can be further taken apart, but we never get to a point where we can literally see what is really happening since modern microchip connections are allegedly around 70 atoms. You can make simple circuits at home but anything complex requires prebuilt microchip parts. People “build their own computers” but that really means they order the prebuilt parts.

Try building your own microchips and you won’t get far without their high tech laser equipment that can allegedly etch at the atomic scale. Experts in the field do most of their research in books or through computers which are already built with electronics and so it is hard to find a source who truly has a first hand understanding from the most basic inner workings of a complex electronic device.

Even those who do programming don’t work to actually build the physical transistors and most have limited theoretical knowledge for how the chips themselves are layed out. It would be interesting to talk to someone who designed the physical parts inside a Solid State Drive or othe microprocessor.

Not the programming, but the physical inner workings. I will link some videos of people supposedly trying to explain the inner workings of these microchips but upon watching them I am more reminded of some of the absurdly complex lectures on relativity.

Some of the “math” may work which will satisfy most technical minded people, but for me the “logic” for why they amplify and re-amplify electric charges thousands of times as these “electric charges” zip around these boards just never seems to connect to running a computer or even computing logic.

I could just be too dumb to understand them, but it’s also possible something else is going on.

The official story for how microprocessors Work:

Microchips are allegedly constructed by a process called nanolithography or microlithography.

Tiny lasers are shot at layers of material to burn out paths that connect literally billions of transistors, capacitors, and other components, each just 70 atoms thick. On many solid state drives in a computer these transistors are literally designed to hold single electrons.

Think about that.

We can’t even see electrons.

More recently it’s been theorized electrons are just a “cloud of probability” so how can it hold them?

A chip the size of your fingernail can have billions of transistors on it and can process billions of logical processes per second.

All this processing runs smoothly enough to create entire Interactive computer games, videos, Internet, and all the other distractions that keep us transfixed to these enchanting devices for years of our life.

A zoomed in look at how small microchips are:

Physical Creation of these Transistors seems logically impossible.

How can they move a laser so precisely to etch out these carvings?

Literally, what motor is turning to move the laser arm so precisely?

How does burning away layers of material create all of the complex transistors and other components?

For many microchips they are not simply rows of the same type of component rather there appears to be varying types of electronic components and transistors and capacitors all interweaving on a single chip.

Here is a picture of a microchip from an encyclopedia that was published in 1994.

This microchip only has 1,238 transistors and other components, they are much larger than today’s components and yet they are barely still visible. But look at the insane complexity at this scale! Compare this to today’s microchips that have several billion transistors on this same size chip. 1000 transistors can fit onto the width of a human hair. Is this really possible? I believe it’s healthy to at least question this claim.

Logic Design?

In addition to the physical creation of these microchips seemingly being impossible, how these transistors actually translate into logical computer code also completely eludes me. Transistors seem to act like gates that allow the flow of an electric current to pass through them, but how does connecting thousands of these correlate into logical design to run a program? These transistors that open and close are supposed to be the most fundamental level of making programs run on the computer, but then what “program” is telling the transistors to open or close in logical ways? It just seems like you’ll always need another fundamental level of programming “instructing” for the next fundamental level if that makes sense.

Healthy Skepticism

Are we really capable of such precise complex engineering? Perhaps, but I also used to think the space program was possible. So now I wonder if there is again a more likely reasoning behind this microchip design rather than the official story.

It should be noted that Intel was funded by the government specifically the Pentagon. They supposedly wanted to develop microchips to guide their missiles.

## An attempt at unbiased perspective
We are so entrenched into our view of the world that it is hard for us to consider other possibilities. But let’s try to form an unbiased view by considering if we showed a person from two hundred years ago a computer or smart phone.

Their more natural view may lend some unbiased insight:

I believe this person would immediately say the phone was using magic.

When asked what they mean by “magic” they would likely think there must be some “magical spirit” that is inside the device running it.

We would of course laugh and tell them no, actually it is all made from physical tiny machines. Billions of them.

So of course they would not believe this. So we would take one apart and show the electronic components. And they would hold a SSD card or Microchip in their hand and ask how can this make the computer work? And we would tell him that inside it were billions of smaller devices called transistors that bounce around pieces of electricity so precisely that it creates logic that can process billions of connections per second to make games, music, and pictures work.

And he would say he doesn’t believe us and to prove it. And we would tell him it’s too small to see because they are the size of atoms. And he would think that this is absurd, how would one even begin to physically craft at such a scale? And he would question how we knew this. And we would tell him we learned about it from one of these devices.

My guess is this man would probably find it much more likely that there was some “magic spirit” of sorts living inside this computer device that makes it work. And while at first I would laugh at this I have to ask, is this really that much more outlandish of a claim than billions of complex circuitry?.

Perhaps alchemy is actually the pursuit of experimenting with rare materials such as gold to tap into a magic spirit energy source that we know as electricity, but is actually so much more.

Is it just coincidence that gold happens to be one of the best conductors of electricity? Followed by silver, and then copper I believe.

Strikingly similar to our value system for these metals years before this discovery. So, did alchemy actually ever stop, or did it just go into hiding again after being persecuted? Could modern circuit boards be the result of these hundreds of years of continued secret alchemy study? Could our mainstream modern understanding of chemistry and atomic theory be actually a clever guise to hide a more supernatural truth behind these processes?

The reasoning being obvious that they of course want to avoid being accused of witchcraft and also they don’t want us to obtain the powers for ourselves concerning this electric-spirit because then we would not need them and they would not be in control.

It’s possible our understanding of chemistry and atomic theory has elements of truth in it but never gets us the whole picture. Similar to that of a heliocentric model of the universe sort of working until you compare it to the flat earth model which works much better.

The real truth may be hidden in complexity and distracting ideas that are all red herrings to hide the truth. Similarly to how alchemist hid their inventions recipes through cryptic language. Our current understanding of the atom has changed so much since its original conception, from a structure to a cloud, to essentially pure energy at undefined points, that it perhaps should have been thrown out all together and reconsidered from scratch. But physics has a way of just “patching up” their broken theories rather than consider alternatives.

History of Spiritualism in Science When researching for this theory I was surprised to find that many of the famous discoverers of electricity actually believed electricity was interacting with the spiritual realm. Electricity came during the 1880s when “Spiritualism” was prominent.

Thomas Edison, the father of electricity was surprisingly into the occult. It was even rumored he had invented a device that could communicate with the dead. Tesla was also very spiritual and he too was trying to invent a “spirit phone” to communicate with the dead.

Other investors pursuing spiritual inventions included Alexander Bell, sir Oliver Lodge, and Marconi, the inventor of the electric telegraphy. The degree of their success in this supernatural pursuit could be interpreted differently depending on whether or not electricity is a form of communicating with the spirits. Many people of the time considered this a possible explanation for these electronic devices. So then why is electricity today viewed from an entirely secular perspective?

Further research is needed but my guess is the same reason alchemy became banished; people feared it was evil to tamper with the supernatural and science didn’t want to be harshly persecuted again as it had during the hay day of alchemy, so it tried to explain it in purely materialistic terms.

But even when alchemy was officially outlawed the kings would often still have personal alchemists because they wanted to use their discoveries for themselves. And electricity inventions were far too useful to ignore; so perhaps they hid the real reason for how they worked so it would be accepted by religious people.

This would also have the added benefit of keeping the knowledge for manipulating this phenomenon of electricity more secretive therefore easier to control sense most people would be trying to understand electricity on a physical materialistic level they would not be as successful at creating new inventions with it.

Interestingly, there was a disagreement between Tesla and Edison on the nature of electricity with Tesla believing there was a spiritual explanation and Edison insisting it could all be explained materialistically (despite Edison later siding with Tesla’s idea when trying to create a spirit phone).

Whether connected or not, Tesla’s lab was burned and his inventions destroyed, while and Edison became rich. And today we describe electricity in a purely materialistic view. In fact basically any credible study by a scientist on this subject is basically disregarded no matter the outcome.

Here is a list of some of the electronics I find most skeptical for their given explanation:

Speakers Don’t Make Logical Sense

A guitar is shaped in a specific shape so that it can create the specific sound a guitar makes. Same with a piano. Or a violin. Or any instrument. They all have a very unique shape and material. So how is it that a speaker shape can produce all of these sounds (guitar, violin, piano, etc.) nearly identical to the instrument without being a similar shape or material as the instrument?

In what precise way is the speaker cone vibrating to produce the different sounds of a guitar, a piano, a human voice, and all the other instruments? If this is possible why is it only electronic devices that can create this ridiculously vast array of instruments from a single shape? (The speaker cone shape). Is it possible to play a violin sound from a speaker box shaped instrument that is not electronic? Theoretically it should be, yet I’ve never heard of this.

Bonus Theory on Sound: I’m not an expert on this yet but my initial studying leads me to think sound is probably a unique wave, or atleast some moving energetic force.

Mainstream view of sound says that it is not a wave itself (in the way a radio wave is a wave) but rather a physical phenomenon that occurs because air atoms “bump” into one another like a chain of dominoes to create a “compression wave” movement that eventually bumps into your eardrum. Your eardrum is then allegedly able to decipher exactly what instrument is playing purely from the pattern of the air molecules bumping into it. This is analogous to you being able to tell which friend jumped in the pool based on the waves that splash on you.



There’s just too much subtlety that is lost. To me it makes far more sense that sound is a wave of unique energy that travels through the air to your eardrums and your eardrums decipher the sound itself. I believe that as the sound wave passes through the air it vibrates the air molecules but this vibration is simply a biproduct of the sound wave rather the sound wave itself. How the eardrum deciphers the sound energy wave is a mystery but it could still have to do with vibrations since the sound wave would be much more accurate to the sound than a bumping of air molecules would be. As for vacuums not having sound? First, I’m entirely convinced they don’t. But even if they don’t, it is possible sound waves need to travel through air.



That would not prove the air itself was or was not the sound wave, simply that it may require it. Similarly, a bird needs air to travel through, but that does not mean the air is the bird. However, if sound can travel through a vacuum that would certainly disprove sound being a physical phenomenon and prove it is a unique wave. The problem with all of the videos on YouTube testing this is they don’t record the sound from INSIDE the vacuum, so we can’t tell if the vacuum container is what was blocking the sound. Frustratingly, the only video that did do this did not show the results he just told us it didn’t record sound.



Apparently there have now been several mainstream articles claiming sound CAN travel in a vacuum. Of course they immediately have reasons for it, one being the sound wave is traveling on top of an electromagnetic wave? Or that the particles that “bump” into each other are just really far away? It all sounded like desperate conjecture to explain that sound couldn’t possibly be a wave itself. Anyways, this is off topic. More research is needed.

Vinyl Record Players don’t make sense for storing sound information Have you ever critically considered the explanation for how a record player works? Beyond the speaker making these impossible sounds, how does the speaker actually “read” the sound it needs to make based on a needle bumping along a groove?

I get the concept, that the different ‘bumps’ on the record are read as different levels of vibration and thus interpreted into sound, but on a practical stand I can’t understand how the speaker could read much past Morse code from bumps in a groove, yet somehow they are able to play full orchestras and thousands of instruments with subtle variation from these tiny bumps on a groove.



It seems like an impossible amount of accuracy and information to translate on a record ‘bump’. In addition, some records claim to transfer the information for surround sound too! Take a look at this video of a record player in slow-motion through a microscope, does it really look like the information of an entire orchestra is encoded here?

Interestingly the tip of the needle is made of diamond, allegedly only because it is hard, but perhaps the information is actually being encoded in this crystalline structure rather than the grooves of the record.

Recent mainstream articles show research that diamonds could be used as super efficient information storage devices.

Another Vinyl Record played under microscope https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCdsyCWmt8
What’s more, the needle seems to be going off its track several times. I wonder if this stopped the song? More zoomed in study of the record being played may reveal some deeper secrets. Another idea, according to mainstream theory of how records work you could allegedly take a blank disc of plastic and carve out grooves with a knife in such a way to recreate a guitar solo or any other sound if done right.

Phonograph Machine

Let’s look at the earliest types of record players to see if we can decipher what is really going on. The first recording device was invented by Thomas Edison and was called the phonograph. It worked by someone singing and playing guitar while a needle etched into a cylinder made of bees wax or soap (animal fat) or tin foil.



If I observed this process without a biased influence what might I think is happening? My thought would be that this needle was running along this cylinder and somehow forming a “memory” of this moment into the cylinder itself. Exactly how this worked I wouldn’t know. But I believe I would be led to propose that perhaps inorganic objects can hold a “memory” of sorts (in this case of a song). But perhaps that’s not entirely true since the bees wax or animal fat is technically organic.

But still, how could this material possibly hold memory? Memory is stored in the brain, right? Allegedly In material mechanistic components called synapses that fire and release just like a machine. Right? Maybe not. Even today with all our “advanced” technology that science institutions have given us we still do not know where memory is stored nor have the faintest clue how it actually works.

So what if memory is more of a “force” or “trait”, (perhaps similar to the electric-spirit) that encompasses our world. And our minds are simply tapping into this infinite memory. What if memory is actually a “slice of time” that is being focused on by our minds.

So that when we remember something our minds litterally travel back in time to re-experience this moment again. Perhaps records are doing the same thing. These “memories” of the past don’t seem to interrupt or change this past (at least not often… Mandela effect?) but seem to instead simply re-live it through bringing back the sound of that recording.

Maybe seeing ghosts is actually someone from the future remembering the past. Does that mean you could go back and warn yourself about the future? Maybe not. But maybe you could write the future by imagining it in your present mind. Is that a paradox?

So, basically the wax cylinder stores the memory of this recording in time and saves it for access later by replaying it.

Of course, this is only a theory that I might logically think of when observing what is happening of this phenomenon from this invention. The alternative (and, official story) is that little microscopic “bumps” are created on the wax roll.

Then later when played back the needle bumps over these bumps again and bounces it up and down which moves a diaphragm connected to a speaker which somehow reproduce the exact intricate sounds of a person singing and guitar playing.

Supposedly nothing about it cannot be explained with physical mechanics of bumps and grooves bouncing a needle up and down. I believe the only reason this even seems possible is because it is what we are told. But how many people have really questioned this explanation?

Phonograph machine https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJXDtrq4McY&list=PLNiM9M2Z_Y_3izH6lSAJVauaF1ZHAA2iM&index=15
CDs

As we work our way up in record technology the reasoning behind the method still seems mysterious. Allegedly, a laser scans across a disc to reflect back or not which creates a binary string of ‘on’ or ‘off’ signals. This is then interpreted as information.

In theory perhaps this works, although the sheer amount of information that can be stored on CDs is staggering. It’s also rather confusing to see exactly how the laser swings around to accurately find the location for the information.

Allegedly the first perimeter of encoded information tells it where all the information is located to access it further. But how can the laser target any specific point with it spinning so fast? A more detailed examination should be done. Perhaps see if the laser is indeed thin enough to actually target these nanometer points without hitting a collection of them.

Television

How do televisions unscramble a linear stream of radio signals into a full moving video image? What is the intelligence or logic behind the unscrambling of this stream of bits to make it into a picture?

I’ve read about some of the details of cathode-ray tubes and how it allegedly beams back and forth very quickly across the television to form an image on the screen, but frankly I find the explanation rather impossible seeming for how it does this. Still, more research is needed.

Limited First-Hand Experiences

Do you know anyone who designs electronic circuits? Not works in the factory and does one tiny part but I mean someone in charge of having a full picture of what they are creating when they physically piece together the inner transistors (the size of 70 atoms) of a new microchip.

There should be a design director of sorts I just don’t know of any I could talk to first-hand. The thing is even if there is someone who does this circuit board design job the entire process could be claimed to be too complex and compartmentalized enough that no one single person has a full grasp of how the process works.

Also, I find often they piece together microchips that are already fully built in other places. And even if they are completely legitimate electronic designs I’m sure the companies would not want to give up their trade secrets, so first-hand experiences of this knowledge are very limited.

Taking Electronics Apart

I watched videos of people taking apart electronics. Transistors. Capacitors. Batteries. Etc. Like literally just cutting them in half with a pair of pliers to see the inside. I actually used to do this a lot as a kid too. What is strange is there seems to be basically nothing inside of them. Usually just a solid looking chunk of metal or plastic with maybe a metal strip inside.

I just thought they would be more intricate inside if there are literally billions of transistors. It’s really odd to me. Again, I don’t know exactly how they work but this finding might help someone who does to see if it makes sense to them? I would really like to cut open a flash memory to see if it is complex, but I guess it may be too small to see. Anyone have a microscope?

Further Research Ideas for how to prove (or disprove) this theory that electronics do not work the way they tell us and may in fact have supernatural properties:

Examine the inside of microchip under a microscope to see if you can actually see the billions of tiny transistors.

I don’t have a microscope but if someone does this might be a good test. Try to build your own phonograph machine might give insight into how they work. Though it wouldn’t really prove or disprove the reason for why it works.

In fact, it’s maybe possible the people making them don’t fully understand how they work, just that they work. Building a computer chip probably would reveal the inner workings but I don’t think there’s much chance of being able to do this.

Examine further the process for how the computer chips are made. Perhaps a first hand tour of the design process Test alternative ways for creating electronics based on viewing electricity as a living force. Admittedly, I’m not sure how to even approach this method. Perhaps studying alchemy proposals or other ancient alternative methods for manipulation of energy.

Hypothetical Explanations for How these electronics and energy fields may work. The following theories attempting propose some explanations for how these microchips might be explained are highly theoretical.

I don’t claim any proof for them it’s more to get us thinking and wondering about other explanations. It’s a bit like trying to consider what is past our continents; no one really knows but I think it’s interesting to propose theories. Just remember the following is just speculation and logical imagination:

Theory 1 - Magic the aether is an intelligent energy field that can be tapped into to intelligently power devices through electricity. There are most likely closely guarded laws that govern how to tap into and manipulate this energy field that is understood by a few scientists though probably still being studied. The “scientific laws” are logical but may more closely resemble some of the rules of ancient magic. These may be hidden in scientific terms. It’s possible this would explain the obsession with the occult with many of the elite organizations while simultaneously repressing the supernatural studies from the masses.

Theory 2 - Hidden Sciences It’s also possible the explanations behind these microchips may be purely scientific and not have any intelligent spirit force behind it, but instead the forces are easier to manipulate than described and the rules for them kept secret. The “magic” side could be a psyiop to distract from real hidden sciences. Whether hidden science or “magic” may be mostly indistinguishable if the laws and methods are very different.

Theory 3 - "Alien" tech from another land or pond of the plane. Another possibility is these electronics are “gifts” from a far more advanced civilization. Perhaps from a far off continent, or from the future.

I’m reminded of the crop circle of the “alien” holding a CD disc allegedly saying “beware the bearers of false gifts and their broken promises.” Of course, these crop circles may be a psyop but they may also hold some hidden truth in plain site.

A darker theory is they are controlling us with these technologies. I think more likely they are guiding us, or perhaps experimenting a little. There may be varying factions and goals. If this is the case the technology likely is powered differently than how it is taught in our text books because they don’t want us using the energy to create other things, rather they want to control it.

If this is the case we may could find new energy in these devices by studying them closely. Or perhaps they do work as described but the aliens are simply advanced enough to actually craft these electronic devices such as microchips with billions of transistors.

Theory 4 - honest misunderstandings It could be less nefarious. It could be that the scientists really don’t understand themselves how it works and yet it does work and so they feel compelled to have an explanation for it.

Edison saw the phonograph needle was making grooves in the cylinder and so he assumed this was the cause for holding the sound. He didn’t really even consider the electric field was “recording a memory of it” because he didn’t understand that.

Or he did consider it but found it too frightening. Since then it could be that our scientific discoveries have taken off in development with our explanations lagging behind for “why” these things were working.

Theory 5 - it’s possible they actually work like they say It’s admittedly possible microchips and electronics work exactly like they tell us. Perhaps I’m not smart enough to comprehend their design process.

Perhaps I am merely so distrusting of scientific authority that I am incorrectly blanketing my distrust onto all sciences. It’s possible, but then I look at that microchip again and think about the billions of transistors the size of atoms that needed to be made so perfectly.

And again I feel the odds of them being able to build these and them working the way they tell us just doesn’t seem as likely. Of course that’s just a feeling based on logical observation, but atleast it’s enough to make me question it further.

Thank you for the time in reading this theory.

It’s not proof, it’s admittedly still more in the form of observations and skepticism for the current explanation of electronics and a curiosity for if there may be another explanation.

Hopefully it leads to further ideas whether proving or disproving the current explanation.

Any Ideas for furthering this inquiry are welcome
